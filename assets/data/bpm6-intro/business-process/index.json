Enterprises and Business Processes</h2>\n<p>The modern business environment is rapidly evolving due to globalization and advancements in IT technologies. To adapt to these changes, companies are transforming from traditional corporate structures and operational models into new forms. Table 1-1 illustrates this shift: companies are moving from a cost-centric to a time-centric approach, from a product-centric to a customer-centric model, from self-processing to outsourcing, from scale-focused to agility-focused structures, and from mass production of few varieties to small-batch production of diverse products. In terms of organizational structure, companies are transitioning from hierarchical, function-centered organizations to decentralized, process-oriented ones. As business operations increasingly emphasize process efficiency, companies are focusing on <strong>Process Innovation (PI)</strong> and <strong>Business Process Reengineering (BPR)</strong> to secure competitiveness.</p>\n<h3>Table 1-1: Changes in the Business Environment</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Past / Present</th>\n<th>Present / Future</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Cost</td>\n<td>Time</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Asset-based (Product-centric)</td>\n<td>Market-based (Customer-centric)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Self-processing</td>\n<td>Outsourcing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scale</td>\n<td>Agility</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Function-centric / Hierarchical</td>\n<td>Process-centric / Decentralized</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mass production of few varieties</td>\n<td>Small-batch production of diverse products</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>During the industrial era of mass production, business organizations were structured based on Frederick Taylor’s <strong>Scientific Management</strong>, characterized by specialization and hierarchical functional structures. While this structure was effective for repetitive and standardized tasks, it has struggled to keep up with recent environmental changes such as shorter product life cycles, diverse consumer demands, market liberalization, and globalization. Modern business structures are evolving towards decentralization, greater autonomy in task execution, networked organizations, and lifelong learning. These trends align with the shift towards customer and process-centered organizational structures, where responsibility is shared across processes rather than confined to individual functions.</p>\n<p>As businesses increasingly embrace process-centric organizations, understanding business processes becomes crucial. Before delving into business processes, it is important to define business systems. A business system is an organization that provides valuable outcomes to stakeholders interested in its outputs. Essentially, a business system is an economic entity that produces and sells goods or services to fulfill human needs while pursuing profit.<br></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Key concepts in defining a business system</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A business process, which consists of activities performed within an enterprise.</li>\n<li>Resources used in executing processes.</li>\n<li>Business objectives or outputs.</li>\n<li>Rules that define or constrain the business environment.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Corporate objectives are achieved through processes, which express the desired state of resources, and rules represent the accumulated knowledge within the enterprise. Among the concepts that define an enterprise system, business process is the most important, so what is a business process? Generally, a process can be defined as the processing procedure or flow of activities that transforms inputs into outputs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Classification of Processes within an Enterprise</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Material Process</strong>: The process of handling raw materials and components to provide finished products</li>\n<li><strong>Information Process</strong>: The process of processing data to provide information</li>\n<li><strong>Business Process</strong>: The process of handling transactions to achieve customer satisfaction</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Looking at the specific definition of a business process, a business process is a collection of interconnected unit tasks that begins with a specific event and creates a defined output for the process customer. The customer-oriented perspective is particularly important in processes, and customers are divided into internal and external customers. Process output is the reason for the existence of the business process and should be identifiable and quantifiable. And the unit tasks, which are components of the process, are interrelated, and these unit tasks are performed by appropriate personnel during the execution of the process.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Attributes of Business Process</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Definition</strong>: It can be described.</li>\n<li><strong>Reusability</strong>: It can be repeated.</li>\n<li><strong>Analysis/Evaluation</strong>: It can be measured.</li>\n<li><strong>Prediction</strong>: Results can be identified.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The successful execution of business processes is essential for corporate survival. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Characteristics of Business Processes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A business process has a clear purpose.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>It has defined inputs and outputs.</li>\n<li>It utilizes resources.</li>\n<li>It consists of multiple activities performed in a specific sequence.</li>\n<li>It impacts one or more organizational units and is more horizontal than hierarchical.</li>\n<li>It delivers value to both internal and external customers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With these characteristics, typical business processes include new product development processes, product or material ordering processes, insurance claim processing/payment processes, and order fulfillment processes from order to shipment. Additionally, business processes can be classified into three categories, which are as follows.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Business Process Classification</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>1) Classification according to organizational units involved in the process</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Processes between different enterprise organizations</li>\n<li>Processes between departments within an enterprise</li>\n<li>Processes between personnel within a department</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>2) Classification according to the object being processed</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Physical processes such as the manufacturing of electronic products</li>\n<li>Intangible information processes such as proposal preparation tasks</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>3) Classification according to the type of activities performed</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Administrative processes</li>\n<li>Operational processes</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An example of an inter-enterprise process is the material procurement process, which involves two or more consumer and supplier organizations. In this case, the key is to reduce transaction costs and minimize transaction steps. An example of an interdepartmental process is new product development, where breaking down regional boundaries and ensuring simultaneity between tasks is crucial. An example of a process between personnel within a department is the loan approval process in a bank.</p>\n<p>An example of operational work is entering customer orders, where the key is improving the quality of outputs, reducing processing time, and cutting costs. An example of an administrative process is the budget preparation process, where enhancing analytical capabilities and expanding participant involvement are essential.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-bprbusiness-process-reengineering\"><a href=\"#2-bprbusiness-process-reengineering\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>2. BPR(Business Process Reengineering)</h2>\n<p>The recent rapid changes in the business environment can be summarized as a shift of power from suppliers to customers, competition between companies across national borders, and dramatic changes in technology and markets. BPR (Business Process Reengineering) means thoroughly analyzing existing processes and boldly redesigning them to achieve breakthrough improvements in company performance. In other words, BPR simplifies business processes to eliminate excessive delays and reduce high costs in business operations. In this way, by using BPR, companies can operate business processes that deliver better performance.</p>\n<p><img class=\"g-image g-image--lazy g-image--loading\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg

major stages, as shown in Figure 1-1.<br></p>\n<p><strong>Stage 1</strong>: Diagnose the current process to identify issues.<br>\n<strong>Stage 2</strong>: Perform a thorough analysis of the existing process and redesign a new process.<br>\n<strong>Stage 3</strong>: Reconstruct the system for the new process.<br>\n<strong>Stage 4</strong>: Operate the redesigned process using the reconstructed system.<br></p>\n<p>This execution process is repetitive. In the diagnosis stage, an evaluation of the current process's KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) is conducted to analyze both the current and future situations, followed by simulations to predict future scenarios. In the redesign stage, new scenarios for the new process are modeled. In the reconstruction stage, the existing business processes are restructured, and the information systems are newly built to execute the newly designed process. Recently, key information technologies enabling BPR, such as workflow management systems and their extended concept of Business Process Management Systems (BPMS), are being actively introduced. Finally, in the operation stage, necessary management information is collected for execution instructions related to daily tasks and for future analysis.\n<br><br>\nA concept that contrasts with BPR is CPI (Continuous Process Improvement). While BPR refers to fundamentally reanalyzing and boldly redesigning existing processes to achieve a breakthrough improvement in performance, CPI focuses on the gradual improvement of work processes and outputs over a long period.\nWhen comparing BPR and CPI from several aspects<br></p>\n<ul>\n<li>In terms of the depth of change, BPR is drastic, while CPI is gradual.<br></li>\n<li>BPR disregards the existing process and starts from scratch, whereas CPI acknowledges the existing process and begins with improving it.<br></li>\n<li>Regarding the frequency of change, BPR changes all at once, while CPI is continuously evolving.<br></li>\n<li>In terms of time required, BPR takes a longer time, while CPI is relatively shorter.<br></li>\n<li>From a scope perspective, BPR is broad and involves multiple departments, whereas CPI is narrow and typically performed within a single department.<br></li>\n<li>In terms of risk, BPR carries a higher level of risk, while CPI is relatively lower in risk.<br></li>\n<li>The involvement of organizational members differs: BPR is top-down, while CPI is bottom-up.<br>\n<br></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Past experiences have shown that BPR projects fail when appropriate change management is not accompanied and when they rely solely on technical solutions. As shown in Figure 1-2, comparing BPR and CPI based on their occurrence frequency and the magnitude of impact, CPI has a smaller impact but occurs frequently, whereas BPR has a larger impact but occurs less frequently. However, CPI and BPR are not mutually exclusive; rather, they are complementary. In other words, after a certain level of gradual improvement through CPI, BPR, which involves a more intense change, is carried out. After a certain period, the process is complemented by gradual CPI improvements, as shown in Figure 1-3.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img class=\"g-image g-image--lazy g-image--loading\"

Time</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As mentioned above, the BPR life cycle consists of four stages. For the first two stages of the BPR life cycle—problem diagnosis and process (re)design—a systematic method for modeling and analyzing the current business is necessary. In the 3rd and 4th stages, which involve system (re)building and operation, the introduction of BPMS (Business Process Management System) is essential to support the successful execution of the new process. Below, we will explain business modeling and BPM(S).</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-business-modeling-and-analysis\"><a href=\"#3-business-modeling-and-analysis\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>3. Business Modeling and Analysis</h2>\n<p>In the BPR life cycle, to diagnose issues in the existing process and redesign the new process, it is essential to thoroughly analyze the current business. However, in practice, conducting various experiments to understand the business mechanisms through real-world operations is not easy. This is similar to the difficulty of predicting the causes and direction of a tornado by experimenting with an actual tornado. Therefore, to analyze the existing issues, we need alternatives that allow for various experiments, and we refer to this as a model. A model is a simplified representation of the complex real world, where irrelevant details are removed, and only the important aspects are focused on. Since the real world is too vast and complex to analyze in its entirety, we abstract or condense only the areas of interest to create a model. Examples of models we encounter in daily life include architectural blueprints or maps. Not all maps represent the entire real world in detail; for instance, contour maps focus only on elevation information. In other words, when we are interested in the elevation information of a specific location, we create a contour model.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img class=\"g-image g-image--lazy g-image--loading\"

model can be a house, a machine, or an information system, among others. In the case of business processes, the focus is on creating models of the enterprise (business). The process of creating a model is called modeling, and the act of examining the inside of the model using the model is called analysis. The reason for creating a business model is that the enterprise, as the subject of the model, is a complex system with a wide variety of processes, items, and decision variables, making it difficult to understand the whole at a glance. In business operations, the following are typically required:<br></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Appropriate knowledge of the current situation and business goals<br></li>\n<li>Timely process adjustments<br></li>\n<li>Sound and reliable information system architecture and management<br></li>\n<li>Establishment of rigorous resource management policies<br></li>\n<li>Maintenance of an appropriate organizational structure<br></li>\n</ul>\n<p>To achieve this, it is necessary to understand the components of the business and their relationships, and a business model is required as a means to manage complexity.<br></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Reasons for Business Process Modeling<br></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mechanism</strong>: To understand the key mechanisms of the current processes.<br></li>\n<li><strong>Information Systems</strong>: To serve as a foundation for building an appropriate information system.<br></li>\n<li><strong>Operational Improvement</strong>: To serve as a foundation for improving the current business structure or operations.<br></li>\n<li><strong>Future Vision</strong>: To present a desirable future business structure.<br></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Key modeling elements necessary for business process modeling<br></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Process</strong>: A collection of activities that provide value to customers through their outputs.<br></li>\n<li><strong>Resource</strong>: Physical, abstract, or human resources, including information, used within the process.<br></li>\n<li><strong>Rules &#x26; Goals</strong>: The rules that define or constrain the processes of a business and, finally, the goal representing the desired state of the business resources.<br></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The scope of business modeling must include what, how, when, and who within the organization. <strong>What</strong> refers to the tasks performed in the company and the objects of those tasks. <strong>How</strong> defines the company's actions, i.e., how the work is carried out. <strong>When</strong> refers to the concept of time, one of the major components of the model, which is expressed in relation to events that change the state of the business at specific points in time. <strong>Who</strong> refers to the resources or participants within the company who perform the business processes.\nThe scope of business modeling can be summarized into four main aspects, as shown in Figure 1-5.<br></p>\n<p><strong>Function</strong>: The aspect concerning what has been performed within the company (function)<br>\n<strong>Behavior</strong>: The aspect concerning when and how the activities were carried out (behavior)<br>\n<strong>Information</strong>: The aspect concerning what data is generated, used, and the relationships between the data (information)<br>\n<strong>Organization</strong>: The aspect concerning who and where the tasks are to be performed within the organization

business modeling methods include IDEF, ARIS, Petri Net, and UML.</p>\n<p><strong>IDEF</strong> stands for ICAM Definition, where ICAM refers to the CIM project conducted by the U.S. Air Force. IDEF refers to the collection of modeling methods devised and used in this project. The methods primarily used in business modeling are IDEF0, which models functional aspects, IDEF1, which models information, and IDEF3, which models dynamic activities within a company. IDEF0 is a method designed to model the activities and decision-making processes of a system or organization. It is simple to use and has a hierarchical structure, but it does not express temporal aspects. IDEF1 is a method designed to clearly represent and analyze the information resource management requirements of an organization. It is a method for analyzing the information needed within an organization, but it is not a database design method. For reference, the database design method exists separately under the name IDEF1x. IDEF3 expresses how a specific system or organization operates and provides two methods: one represents how things are carried out from a <strong>process flow perspective</strong> (process schematics), while the other expresses how the <strong>state changes of specific objects</strong> transition (object schematics).</p>\n<p><strong>ARIS</strong> is a methodology devised by Dr. Scheer from Germany, primarily developed for modeling information systems. ARIS stands for Architecture of Integrated Information Systems. In ARIS, a company is modeled from the perspectives of organization, data, functionality, and integration, which are represented by the ARIS House.</p>\n<p><strong>Petri Net</strong> was devised by Adam Petri in 1962 and was originally designed for modeling computer systems. Since Petri Net is based on a mathematical formalism, it is widely used not only as a modeling tool but also as an analysis tool. Additionally, Petri Net is a state/event-integrated modeling tool that represents both the events and states of the target system.</p>\n<p><strong>UML</strong> stands for Unified Modeling Language and is a standard method for object-oriented modeling. Originally developed to model software systems, UML is now widely used to model not only software systems but also business systems. The current version of UML is 2.0, and it provides a total of 13 diagrams.</p>\n<p>Tools for business process modeling that express the dynamic aspects of business include Petri Net, UML activity diagrams, ARIS EPC (Event-driven Process Chain), and IDEF3 Process Schematics.</p>\n<p>After modeling the business using various modeling tools for the current process, it is necessary to carefully examine the internal structure, which is called analysis. The purpose of analysis is to gain understanding and intuition about the behavior of the modeled system. To break down the objectives of analysis in more detail,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To find the best decision variables of the target system and optimize them  </li>\n<li>To predict the performance of the target system by checking potential plans or sensitivities  </li>\n<li>To select appropriate control rules for the target system  </li>\n<li>To improve the understanding of the target system  </li>\n<li>To justify or widely communicate the decisions related to the target system</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are five main categories. When narrowing the analysis target to business processes, the analysis methods include qualitative methods, which determine logical and structural errors in the target process, and quantitative analysis, which focuses on evaluating the performance of the target process. A representative example of a qualitative method is Petri Net, while quantitative methods include queueing theory and simulation methods.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-bpms\"><a href=\"#4-bpms\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>4. BPM(S)</h2>\n<p>Recently, <strong>BPMS (Business Process Management System)</strong> has been recognized as a key information technology enabling process innovation, and its adoption is spreading. BPMS can be seen as an evolution of the existing <strong>Workflow Management System (WFMS)</strong>. While WFMS focuses on process automation, BPMS emphasizes application integration, collaboration, and process coordination, reflecting the globalized business environment. In other words, BPM has expanded its scope to manage the entire business process lifecycle, as efficient execution of business processes has become crucial for enhancing business competitiveness. It now supports additional functions such as process analysis and diagnostics, which were relatively neglected in workflows. BPM involves using various methods, techniques, and software to support business processes by designing, executing, controlling, and analyzing operational processes, which include people, organizations, application systems, documents, and other information.</p>\n<p>Let's take a look at a few more definitions of BPM,<br></p>\n<ul>\n<li>BPM refers to identifying the current state of processes based on customer demands and expectations, evaluating them, and then improving or reforming them as needed to execute them most appropriately.</li>\n<li>BPM means that, in order to ensure that business processes align with business goals, it includes not only identifying, designing, and deploying business processes but also managerial and administrative control actions.</li>\n<li>BPM is a process that enables continuous improvement in organizational performance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>BPMS, an information system for BPM, refers to a generic software system that operates based on explicit process design to execute, manage, and coordinate process operations throughout the entire business process cycle of diagnosis-(re)design-(re)construction-operation.</p>\n<p>Looking at the transformation and development of the BPM(S) concept from both management system and information system perspectives: from a management system perspective, BPM(S) has evolved from Taylor's scientific management in the 1910s, through ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) in the 1990s, to BPM(S) in the 2000s. Recent BPMS is characterized by workflow-based flexibility, which is referred to as the third wave of BPM. First-generation BPM(S) featured manual business process management, second-generation BPM(S) focused on procedural automation for processing large volumes of transactions, and the third generation focuses on flexible automation of business processes.</p>\n<p>From an information system perspective, BPM(S) evolved from office automation centered on information exchange and sharing such as e-mail and groupware in the 1980s, to workflow centered on document flow automation in the 1990s, when workflow concepts were established and commercial products emerged. Workflow is defined as \"the automation of procedures and processes through which information and tasks are passed between participants according to defined rules to achieve the overall goals of the organization.\" Workflow Management System (WFMS) is defined as \"a system that defines, manages, and executes workflows where the execution sequence is controlled by computer-represented business rules using software.\" The term itself already implies the concept of process automation, making workflow management systems play an important role as a key information technology for BPR success. In the 2000s, it has developed into BPMS, which can be described as strategic information systems centered on collaboration. In other words, recent BPMS is shifting its focus from Automation to Orchestration.</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong><br>\n(1) Takanashi Tomohiro, Mannen Isao, Process Management, Ilbit, 2004.<br>\n(2) Han Kwanhee, Workflow Analysis through Petri Net Transformation of UML Activity Diagram, IE Interfaces, Vol. 17, No.2, pp.200-207, June 2004.<br>\n(3) Davenport, T.H.
