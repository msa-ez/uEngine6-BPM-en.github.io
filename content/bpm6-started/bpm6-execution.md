# Process Execution

## Process Execution

After completing the process creation through process definition, click the 'Process Execution' button located in the upper right corner as shown below to execute the process.

## Work Item
The screen displays the status of the processed work along with two tabs at the top,
in the Progress Status tab, you can check the progress of the current process and the input content of processed tasks.

In the Work Item tab, processes created in modeling are displayed. 'To Do' shows currently ongoing processes, and 'Completed' shows processes that have been previously completed.

## Task Processing
When clicking on a work item in 'To Do', the following screen appears, and participants involved in the ongoing process can complete the process through 'Complete' after performing their tasks.

As you proceed with the process, you can confirm that the incident handling process progresses according to the scenario.


## Simulation and Execution
- This is a function to enter each task and verify operations after process modeling work.

### Simulation
1. Click the button marked in red in the upper right corner of the process modeling screen.
