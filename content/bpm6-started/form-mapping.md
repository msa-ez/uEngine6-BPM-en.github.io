### Data Form Mapping Definition
A configuration tool that can link and transform data between different schemas for integration with other tools (e.g., Legacy Systems) during process execution

### How to Use Form Mapping Between Activities
Mapping processing between activities is performed to change the values of process variables, etc.

When adding process variables, set the variable type to "Form" and then use the field mapping function to add content to the form and connect blocks for each variable to complete the mapping process.

## Form Mapping Process Example

In this chapter, I will explain the process of performing form mapping between activities by adjusting the settings of process variables.

First, create a basic fault report process.

>**Figure 2) Process Variable Settings**

When setting process variables, set the variable type to Form to designate it as a variable that can be mapped.

Then, use the Field Mapping function within each activity to complete the mapping process by connecting blocks for each variable.
