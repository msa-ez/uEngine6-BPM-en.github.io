# How to Use the Modeling Tool

## Process Definition Creation
As shown in the screen below, when you click on process definition on the left, the process designer screen appears, allowing you to create process definitions.

### 1.1 Process Designer Tools
    
At the top of the process designer, there are various Activity Types needed for modeling creation, and this area is called the activity type **palette**.

![](../../uengine-image/1-2-activity_pallete.png)


When you Drag & Drop an Activity, you can see that the selected Activity is added to the process flow chart as shown below.

![](../../uengine-image/1-3-add-activity.png)

When you click on the added Activity, you can set detailed types for the Activity, configure the next Activity to proceed, delete the Activity, and so on.

When you double-click on an Activity, a panel is created in the right area as shown in the screen below.

![](../../uengine-image/1-4-panel.png)

Through this panel, you can set the properties of the Activity such as name, parameters, roles, etc.

### 1.2 Process Data
When you click the '(x)' button located on the left of the activity type palette, the process data screen appears, and by clicking the '+' button, you can set the name and type of variables to be used in the process.

Variables added through process data can be used in Task Activity panel > Add Mapping > Process Data.

## Example Process

### 1. Example Process Description

As an example, we will create and run a process model for an incident process where a user reports an incident, the incident is handled, and then the handling results are communicated to the reporting user.

### 2. Process Scenario

The scenario for the incident handling process is as follows.<br>

1. User reports an incident<br>

2. The administrator checks the incident reported by the user and designates a person in charge to handle the incident<br>

3. The designated person in charge handles the incident and enters the handling result<br>

4. The handling result is delivered to the user<br>

The model completed through the process scenario is as follows.

### 3. Process Definition

The modeling stages of the incident handling process are divided as follows, and each stage can be worked on in parallel as needed.

#### Participant Definition

Participant definition is the stage of defining the roles participating in the process, and the roles in the incident handling process can be classified as follows.<br>

- Roles in the process
  + User: Incident reporter
  + Administrator: Administrator who receives incident tasks and designates person in charge
  + Person in Charge: Incident handler who will actually handle the assigned incident task

To register the roles for the incident handling process as shown in the screen below, proceed with the following steps.
![](../../uengine-image/2-2-lane-set.png)

1. Create a Pool activity on the flow chart using Drag&Drop.

2. After clicking the Pool activity, split it according to the number of participants through the menu that appears on the right.

3. Double-click each lane and set up User, Administrator, and Person in Charge through the panel.

#### Variable Definition

Variable definition is the stage of defining the data to be exchanged at each business stage, and in the example, the following variables are registered in the process data as follows.

| Name | Type |
| ------ | --- |
| troubleDescription | Text |
| troubleType | Text |
| troubleResult | Text |
| selectManager | Text |

#### Flow Definition  

Flow definition is the stage of defining the participants and variables of each business stage and defining the flow between processes, and it proceeds as follows.

1. After drag&drop of Start Event and Task Activity in the lane as follows, modify the name of each business stage through the panel as follows. At this time, place the Start Event in the lane where the first process proceeds.

![](../../uengine-image/1-9-name-set.png)

2. Click on each stage's task activity to designate it as a User task type, and then specify the process variables for each stage.
 - Double-click on the incident report task to open the panel and add the process variables that need to be input, such as incident description (troubleDescription) and incident type (troubleType), to the Parameter Context respectively.

![](../../uengine-image/1-10-trouble-ticket-mapping.png)

< Person in Charge Designation >

|Variable|Direction|
|------|---|
|Trouble_description|→|
|Trouble_type|→|
|Select_manager|↔|

< Incident Handling >

|Variable|Direction|
|------|---|
|Trouble_description|→|
|Trouble_type|→|
|Trouble_result|↔|

< Handling Result Notification >

|Variable|Direction|
|------|---|
|Trouble_result|→|

- If the connection direction is set to "→", the process variable is provided for the user to 'read'. <br>
That is, in the user's task processing screen, the existing value is only displayed on the screen and the value cannot be input. <br>
The default connection direction is "↔", and both the output on the screen and the input field from the user are shown simultaneously.


3. Once the process variables for each Task have been specified, specify the sequence flow according to the flow of the process, and then create and connect an End Event after the incident handling result notification task.
