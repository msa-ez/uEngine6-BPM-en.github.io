1) While there is an obligation to redistribute derivative works, it is not the entire work that needs to be disclosed (as indicated by the "Combinable with Proprietary SW" item), but only the portions modified within uEngine that need to be disclosed on platforms like sf.net. </br>
2) Modifications are mainly made at the configuration file level within uEngine, so source code changes do not occur, but requirements for modifying the splash screen in the admin interface may arise. </br>
3) If you do not wish to disclose any contents of the derivative work, you can purchase commercial licensing (right to not disclose source) according to the "dual licensing" policy.</br>
4) If you want to use uEngine at no cost: - Disclose the modified source code within uEngine on sf.net - Use uEngine without modifying its source code, while indicating the use of uEngine in the user interface, etc. </br>
5) If you want to protect the source code: - Purchase dual licensing (commercial licensing) Source: Korea Copyright Commission: http://www.olis.or.kr/osslice/guideViewComp.do
